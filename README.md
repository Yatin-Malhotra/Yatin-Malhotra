* **The Challenge:** Building a secure, multi-tenant reward economy where point inflation must be monitored and data integrity is critical across four distinct user permission levels.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a Node.js/Express backend utilizing Prisma ORM for complex data aggregations and JWT-based authentication secured with httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS/CSRF attacks. Implemented a custom analytics engine to track "Points-per-Dollar" ratios and cashier processing efficiency.
